# DevOps 30-Day Learning Bootcamp 💻🚀

This repository contains my hands-on DevOps learning journey, structured day-by-day.  
It covers the foundational tools, scripts, automation practices, and cloud usage required for a DevOps Engineer role.

## 🔥 Covered Topics

- ✅ Linux & Shell Scripting (Day 1–5)
- ✅ System Monitoring & Automation Scripts
- ✅ Git & GitHub workflows
- ✅ AWS Core Services (EC2, S3, IAM, ASG, etc.)
- ✅ Docker & Containerization
- ✅ Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- ✅ CI/CD with GitLab
- 🔜 Kubernetes (after Day 15)

## 📁 Structure

Each folder (day1, day2, ...) contains:
- Practical shell scripts or configs
- Real-world use case mini-projects
- A daily `README.md` (explaining what was done)

## 💡 How to Use

```bash
cd day5/
chmod +x scriptname.sh
./scriptname.sh
